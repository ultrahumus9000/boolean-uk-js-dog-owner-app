console.log(data);
// We create individual components here
// - You'll find a variable called data in the console.log. That's your list of dogs
// - Render the top list of dogs using the list item template you'll find on the HTML file
// - Each list item should be clickable. When you click on an item, the selected dog should display on the main card
// - The main card should contain all the information from the selected dog. Follow the template for the main card that you'll find on the HTML file.
// - There should be only one card at the time on the screen
// - The card should have a button that toggles for the selected dog between good dog/ bad dog

// Tips
// - Take advantage of scope in JS to have access to the data you need
// - Remember you can add event listeners to any element on the page

// Challenge
// You might have noticed there's a plus button at the beginning of the top row. Add the behaviour to it. When clicked, it should replace the main card with a form to add a new dog to the list. 
// You'll find a template for the form on the HTML page. Once the form is submitted, add the new dog to the beginning of the list, right next to the plus button.
